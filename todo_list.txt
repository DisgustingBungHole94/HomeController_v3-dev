The Todo List:

Needs immediate attention:

* device_node: Fix seg fault function by implementing server->close_list
    1. create server->close_list, an std::set<int> of fds to be closed at the end of each run loop
    2. For each epoll event in server->run, check that the fd is not in the close_list, continue; if it is
    3. A message from server->close_pipe_r adds an fd to be closed
    4. handle_timeout, handle_close add fds that will be closed
    5. At the end of server->run, call remove_epoll_data for each fd in the close list

Listed in order of priority:

1. homecontroller_api: Remove /login/device & /login/user in favor of unified login request
2. homecontroller_api: Add /connect/device
3. device_node: Cleanup device_handler and ws_handler, refactor similar to how packets are processed in node.tsx
4. homecontroller_api: Setup mongo.db
5. device_node: Investigate close function of server connection as potential cause of SIGPIPE issue
6. homecontroler_api: Change connection->close so recv calls close() when necessary
7. web: Add rememeber me to login, save refresh token as cookie
8. device_node/libhomecontroller: Phase out exceptions in favor of bool return types (specifically for client_packet and state)
9. device_node: Check if device is already online

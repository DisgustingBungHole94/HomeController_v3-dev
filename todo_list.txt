The Todo List:

Needs immediate attention:

* Fix strange device_node behavior upon network change

Listed in order of priority:

1. homecontroller_api: Remove /login/device & /login/user in favor of unified login request
2. homecontroller_api: Add /connect/device
4. homecontroller_api: Setup mongo.db
5. device_node: Investigate close function of server connection as potential cause of SIGPIPE issue
6. homecontroler_api: Change connection->close so recv calls close() when necessary
7. web: Add rememeber me to login, save refresh token as cookie
8. device_node/libhomecontroller: Phase out exceptions in favor of bool return types (specifically for client_packet and state)
9. device_node: Check if device is already online
